# MetaScience

MetaScience is an online service we have developed to help researchers analyze their research profile and that of the conferences/journals where they publish. We rely on the data provided by DBLP, to derive some useful metrics for conferences, journals and authors. 

The conference metrics include:

- **Top 5 authors** and **Top 5 regular authors**
- **Conference activity**. It provides the overall number of authors and papers for each conference edition.
- **Conference ratios**. It presents the number of authors per paper and papers per author for each edition.
- **Community turnover**. Following the popular expression publish or perish, it calculates the percentage of authors that survived/perished between the editions of the conference. 
- **Openness**. It measures how much the community underlying a conference is open towards newcomers. Thus, for each edition it presents the ratio between papers coming from authors that have never published in the conference before (outsiders) as well as the papers with all authors having published there already (community member).
- **Co-author connections**. It shows a graph where nodes represent authors and edges connect co-authors. It helps to identify group of people usually working together.

The journal metrics include:

- **Top 5 authors** and **Top 5 regular authors**
- **Journal activity**. It provides the overall number of authors and papers for each journal issue.
- **Journal ratios**. It presents the number of authors per paper and papers per author for each journal issue.
- **Co-author connections**. It shows a graph where nodes represent authors and edges connect co-authors. It helps to identify group of people usually working together.

The author metrics include:

- **Author activity**. It provides the overall number of papers published classified by type, and the number of pages written.
- **Collaboration evolution**. It presents the average number of co-authored papers and the average number of papers co-authored.
- **Co-author network**. It shows the group of people with whom the author has worked. 
- **Venues network**.  It provides an overview of the venues where the author has published on.

## What is coming next?

The service is under development and we are currently working on many other visualizations/metrics involving:
- Variation of conferencesâ€™ locations and dates, evolution of conference topics,...
 
Of course if you would like MetaScience to show something you have in mind, do not hesitate to contact us or open an issue in our GitHub repository
