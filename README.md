# MetaScience

MetaScience is a new online service we have developed to help on this critical matter. The current version relies on the database provided by DBLP, to derive some useful metrics for conferences and workshops. Such metrics show:

- **Conference activity**. It provides the overall number of authors and papers for each conference edition.
- **Conference ratios**. It presents the number of authors per paper and papers per author for each edition.
- **Community turnover**. Following the popular expression publish or perish, it calculates the percentage of authors that survived/perished between the editions of the conference. In particular, the user can select a unit of time that spans between two consecutive editions or three.
- **Openness**. It measures how much the community underlying a conference is open towards newcomers. Thus, for each edition it presents the ratio between papers coming from authors that have never published in the conference before (outsiders) as well as the papers with all authors having published there already (community member).


## What is coming next?

The service is still under development and we are currently working on many other visualizations/metrics (i.e., PC turnover, variation of conferences’ locations and dates, evolution of conference topics,…). However, if you would like MetaScience to show something you have in mind, do not hesitate to comment on this post or open an issue in our GitHub repository
